# L-Grass
L-Grass is a Functional Structural Plant Model (FSPM) of perennial rye grass morphogenesis and phenology.

L-Grass simulates:
* Above-ground 3D architecture and morphogenesis (leaf extension, growth and tillering) as a self-regulated system. See [Verdenal *et al.* (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1071/FP08050).
* Morphogenesis of the root system in 3D. The model is inspired from ArchiSimple model and accounts for C partioning between shoot and roots. See [Migault thesis (2015)] (https://hal.inrae.fr/tel-02799991)
* Floral transition of individual apex according to temperature and photoperiod, internode elongation and heading date. Ongoing thesis of S. Rouet (2017-2020).

    * [Openalea.Plantgl](https://github.com/openalea/plantgl)
    * [Openalea.Lpy](https://github.com/openalea/lpy)
    * [Alinea.Caribu](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/caribu) 
    * [ephem](https://pypi.org/project/ephem/)
    * [geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/)
    * [xlrd](https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/)
    
## Installing
*Lgrass* has to be installed in a conda environment containing all dependencies.

* Install Miniconda 2 or 3 for Python 3.7: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
* Create a new environment in an Anaconda prompt:
   `conda create -n Lgrass python=3.7 openalea.mtg openalea.plantgl openalea.lpy alinea.caribu ephem geopy xlrd -c conda-forge -c fredboudon`
   
### Users
